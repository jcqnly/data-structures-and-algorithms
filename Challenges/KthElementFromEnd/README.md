# Merge 2 Singly Linked List
Merge 2 singly linked list into 1 singly linked list.

## Challenge
Write a method for that takes in 2 singly linked list and returns one linked list.
Our group decided to make a third linked list to store the merged list.
The value of the first list is added to the new list.  Next the first value of the 2nd list is added to the 3rd list.
Then we set a current pointer to the next value of each of the 2 lists and start traversing from there.
The newly merged list is then returned.
