# Stack Min
Write a method that returns the min element of a stack.  Time complexity 
for push, pop and min needs to be O(1).

This problem is from Cracking the Coding Interview.
However, the [code](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-stack-that-supports-getmin-in-o1-time-and-o1-extra-space/) 
from G4G is much easier to understand.

## Problem Domain Explanation
Since the constraint is to keep push, pop, and min in O(1) time, the min 
needs to be tracked everytime a new Node is added to the stack.
