___

## Problem Solving Process
Strategy 1 - iterate backwards and use StringBuilder:
The given string is split on a space and stored in a new array.  
The new array is then iterated, starting from the end towards the start 
of the array.  As each word is iterated through, the word is appended 
to a String builder as long as it hasn't reached the beginning of the 
array.  If i is 0, then the String builder variable is returned as a string.

Strategy 2 - iterate forwards and use recursion to swap letter:
