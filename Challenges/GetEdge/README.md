# Get Edges
A graph implementation involving edges

## Overview
Given a flight route and a map (displayed as a graph), determine 
if a direct trip is possible.  If there is, let the user know and its price. 
If not, tell the user there isn't a direct flight.

## Problem Solving Process
Since Edges is a property of the Node class and it now needs to have weights,
a dictionary is used because dictionaries can take in more variables than a 
list.

## Whiteboard

A Graph represented as an adjacency list:
