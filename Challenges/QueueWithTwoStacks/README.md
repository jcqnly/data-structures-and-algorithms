# Stack and Queue
Implement a queue using 2 stacks.

---

## Challenge
Given 2 stacks, implement enqueueing and dequeueing concepts in order 
to add or remove a node from the stacks. The pop and push method of
the stack can be used.

---

## Problem Solving Process
The problem domain required the use of stacks, but queue concepts
had to be implemented in order to add or remove a node from the stacks.
Enqueueing(adding) was implemented with the push method and
dequeueing(removing) was implemented with the pop method.
