# FIFO Animal Shelter
Using Queue concepts, implement an animal shelter with a rotating
selection of animals.

---

## Challenge
Given a queue of animals, enqueue (add) an animal to the shelter.
Animal can either be cat or dog.
Using the same queue, dequeue (remove) an animal from the shelter; 
the animal selection will be dependent on a search parameter for
either cat or dog.
Return the longest waiting animal of that type.
For any other parameter, return either a cat or dog, whoever was
waiting the longest.
