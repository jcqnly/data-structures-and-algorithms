# Reverse an Array

## Challenge
Given an array, reverse its contents.  Do not use any built in reverse methods.

## Problem Solving Process
_From June 2018_ Solution is shown in the included picture.  This 
strategy uses O(N) space because a new array is created to store 
the reversed array.  Time complexity is O(N) because the original 
array needs to be iterated through.

_From November 2018_ This strategy implements a recursive approach.
