# Middle of a Linked List
Challenge from [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/).

## Problem Domain
Given a singly linked list, find the middle node.  If the list 
has an even number of nodes, return the second of the middle 2 
nodes.  

## Problem Solving Process
The first FindMiddle method uses a 2N time solution.  The first 
iteration is to find the length in order to find the middle index.  
The second iteration is to travel up to that middle index and 
return that node node.
