# Add 2 Linked Lists

Add the values in 2 linked lists and create a third linked list from 
that sum.

Assume that each node has a value that is one digit long.  The nodes are 
linked to each other in reverse order.  Instead of 3 -> 5 -> 5, it's 
visualized as 3 <- 5 <- 5.

### Input
Linked list1 : 3 <- 5 <- 5

Linked list2 : 5 <- 9 <- 5

### Output
Linked list3 : 9 <- 5 <- 0
