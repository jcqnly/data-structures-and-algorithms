# Remove Dupes From a Sorted Array
Easy difficulty can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/)
- remove duplicates in place so that numbers appear only once 
and return the new length.

Medium difficulty can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/description/).
- remove duplicates in place so that numbers appear _at most twice_ 
and return the new length.

## Problem Solving Process

#### Easy
The solution for the easy problem was found 
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50033837/c-sharp-modify-an-array-in-place-without-creating-another-array-in-memory)

#### Medium
My original solution for the medium difficulty question works on 
Visual Studio and was replicated by a friend on repl.it in Java, 
and it works.  It works because it returns the correct list of numbers. 
The same algorithm does not return the correct numbers on 
LeetCode nor for a job coding challenge on the RexTester IDE.  
No, I was not able to do this in-place as asked.

I have also added an accepted solution for the medium problem.
