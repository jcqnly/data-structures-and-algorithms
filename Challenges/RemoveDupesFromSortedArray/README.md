# Remove Dupes From a Sorted Array
Easy difficulty can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/)
- remove duplicates in place so that numbers appear only once 
and return the new length.

Medium difficulty can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/description/).
- remove duplicates in place so that numbers appear _at most twice_ 
and return the new length.

## Problem Solving Process

#### Easy


#### Medium
My original solution for the medium difficulty question works on 
Visual Studio and was replicated by a friend on repl.it in Java 
and it works.  However, the same algorithm does not return the 
modified array on LeetCode nor for a job coding challenge.
