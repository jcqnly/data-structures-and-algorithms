# FizzBuzz Binary Tree

## Challenge
Write a method named FizzBuzzTree that takes in a binary tree as an argument
and that will determine its 'fizzbuzzyness.'  A node is considered to be
'FizzBuzz' if it's divisible by 15, 'Fizz' if it's divisible by 3,
and 'Buzz' if it's divisible by 5.  If any of the nodes are fizzbuzzy,
change it's contents to reflect it.  Return the tree with the changed
values.

## Problem Solving Process
Our group chose to go the preorder method because the directions said
built in methods were not allowed, which we took to include Enqueue and
Dequeue.  This meant that the breadth traversal route was out of the
question.

Our process will take O(n) in terms of time complexity.  However, in terms
of space complexity, our algorithm is O(1) as no additional space was created.
