# FizzBuzz Binary Tree

## Challenge
Write a method named FizzBuzzTree that takes in a binary tree as an argument
and that will determine its 'fizzbuzzyness.'  A node is considered to be
'FizzBuzz' if it's divisible by 15, 'Fizz' if it's divisible by 3,
and 'Buzz' if it's divisible by 5.  If any of the nodes are fizzbuzzy,
change it's contents to reflect it.  Return the tree with the changed
values.
