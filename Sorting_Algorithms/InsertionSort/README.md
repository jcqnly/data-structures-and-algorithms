# Insertion Sort
Implement an insertion sort

---
## Insertion Sort Further Defined
Insertion sort iterates over an array and checks each number at a time.

Big O of time for the best case scenario, an already ordered array, is O(N) because 
the algorithm still checks every number in the array. 

Big O of time for the worst case, a reversed array, and an average case scenario is 
a quadratic O(N^2).

Big O of space is constant O(1) because no new space is created.
