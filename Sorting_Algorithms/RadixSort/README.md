# Radix Sort
Given an array of numbers, sort it using a radix sort.

## Radix Sort Defined
The radix sort used deals with numbers.  The current code works with the least 
significant digit.  

## Problem Solving Process
First the numbers in the single spot are sorted amongst each other.  If a 
has less digits than the max number of digits, the digits in that spot would 
be a "0".
