# Radix Sort
Given an array of numbers, sort it using a radix sort.

## Radix Sort Defined
The radix sort used deals with numbers.  The current code works with the least 
significant digit.  The LSD of every number is sorted, which would be in the 
one's place.  The next spot would be the 10's spot.  Those numbers would be 
sorted.  The max number of digits used is 3, so the final spot sorted would 
be the hundreds spot.
