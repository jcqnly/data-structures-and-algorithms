# Find the Largest Positive Int in an Array of Ints By Recursion

## Problem Domain
Given an array of ints, find the largest int.

## Why
This is an exercise to gain more familiarity with recursion.  Since the 
naive solution is iterative, I thought about the recursive solution for 
fun.  The [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1984734/finding-the-largest-positive-int-in-an-array-by-recursion) 
implemented was suggested on Stack Overflow and helped me visualize the 
call stack.
