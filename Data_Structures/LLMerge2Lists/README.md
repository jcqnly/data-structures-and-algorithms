# Merge 2 Singly Linked Lists
The ability to traverse in only one direction was challenging.
Not breaking the connection between each nodes, in each list, 
was solved with the use of extra runner nodes that were reference pointers.

## Challenge
Given 2 singly linked lists, merge the two and return the newly merged list.
Two runner nodes were set as extra reference points 
so that an extra list was not needed.  

The solution accounts for when either list is shorter than the other.
