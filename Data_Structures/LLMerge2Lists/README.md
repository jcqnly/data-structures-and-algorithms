# Merge 2 Singly Linked Lists
This challenge was initially solved with an O(N) solution in terms of 
space complexity because a newly third list was made.  
The presented code is an O(1) solution in space complexity because the
nodes of the second list is zipped into the first list.

## Challenge
Given 2 singly linked lists, merge the two and return the newly merged list.
Two runner nodes were set as extra reference points 
so that an extra list was not needed.  This 

The solution accounts for when either list is shorter than the other.
