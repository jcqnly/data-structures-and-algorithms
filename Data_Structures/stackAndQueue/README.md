# Stack and Queue

## Overview
Stacks and queues are data structures that can be represented with nodes.

Stacks represent a FILO concept where the 
first element in will be the last element out.

On the other hand, queues represent a FIFO concept where the 
first element in will be the first element out.

## Challenge
Implement a push, pop and peek method for a stack.
Implement an enqueue, dequeue, and a peek method for a queue.

---

## Concepts Further Defined
**Stacks** allow elements to be taken from and added to the top.
The last element in will be the first element out.
Pushing an element means to add it to the top of the stack.
Popping an element means to remove the top element from the stack.
Peeking refers to having a look at what is the first element.
This is typically connected to the visual image of a stack of plates,
where the last plate stacked on top will be the first to be removed.
Push, pop and peek are all O(1) in time complexity.

**Queues** allow elements to be added to the rear, and it 
allows elements to be removed from the front.  Visually, the rear 
is on the left of the queue of elements while the front is the 
right side of the queue of elements.  Enqueue means to add an element
to the rear of the queue, while dequeue means to remove an element
from the front.  Finally,  peek refers to having a look at the front
node.  Enqueue, dequeue, and peek are all O(1) in time complexity.
