# Stack and Queue

## Overview
Stacks and queues are data structures that can be represented with nodes.

Stacks represent a FILO concept where the 
first element in will be the last element out.

On the other hand, queues represent a FIFO concept where the 
first element in will be the last element out.

## Challenge
